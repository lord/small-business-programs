            <p>
              The COVID-19 outbreak is causing extraordinary disruption for companies
              and non-profits across the United States.
              The NJEDA wants to make it easy for organizations to understand what support
              programs are available to you to help stabilize your operations and
              get back on a pathway to growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a beta version of the Eligibility Wizard that focuses on the Federal
              PPP and SBA disaster loan programs. We will be updating it regularly as new
              federal, state, local, and philanthropic programs become available.
